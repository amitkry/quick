                        <h2>What are the important aspects to improve your typing speed?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A good posture</li>
                            <li>Familier with the keys in the keyboard (Touch Typing)</li>
                            <li>Lots of Practice</li>
                        </ul>
                        Now one by one we will cover all the above mentioned important points. <br><br>
                        <ol>
                        <h2>
                            <li>A Good Posture</li>
                        </h2>    

                        
                        The most important point of all is maintaining a good posture. YES! posture decides your typing speed.
                        <br><br>
                        Now what should be your ideal posture?
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="/images/correct_posture.jpg" alt="Correct Posture">
                        <br><br>
                        The above image shows what should be your posture while sitting in front of your screen.
                        <br><br>
                        The left part of the image shows the wrong posture in which we are usually in the habbit of sitting and this should not be carried further.
                        <br><br>
                        The right part of the image shows the correct posture or the ideal posture in which you are advised to sit.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Quickly moving on to the next image </h4>
                        <br>
                        <img src="/images/sit_stand.jpg" alt="Sitting and standing posture">
                        <br><br>
                        There may be places where you might stand and work. In the above image there is shown the ideal posture for sitting as well as standing.
                        <br><br>
                        
                            <h2>
                                <li>A Good knowledge of Touch Typing</li>
                            </h2> 
                            This is a skill which will come with continuously practicing for a fixed amount of time. According to me you can build this habit of touch typing within 21 days.
                            <br><br>
                            Touch typing is a habit more than a skill in which you can type words and sentences without actually looking at the keyboard which saves your time and ultimately works in increasing your speed.

                            <br><br>
                            <img src="/images/finger_pos.png" alt="Finger Position">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The above image shows initially what should be your finger position on the keyboard.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <img src="/images/fing.jpg" alt="Fingers use" height="300px" width="400px">
                            <br><br>
                            Now look at the image displayed above this shows different fingers to be used to press different keys.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Read the above mentioned points and we are good to proceed toward the third or the last point.
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>
                                <li>Lots of Practice</li>
                            </h2> 
                            No skill can be cultivated without lots and lots of practice. So at last we advice you to practice typing twice a day for 30-40 minutes minimum untill you build a good command on the keyboard.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For this reason we have built this website to help you out in practicing different words and sentences.
                            <br><br>
                        </ol>
